This project aimed to create an automatic feeder for multiple cats. However, please note that development on this multi-feeder has been partially abandoned, as I have shifted focus to a single-feeder project instead. You can find more details about the single-feeder project here: [https://github.com/Poing3000/PurrPleaser3000s](https://github.com/Poing3000/PurrPleaser3000S)

Despite the transition, this repository contains several resources that may still be useful for building a multi-cat feeder, including code examples and schematics.

Feel free to explore and adapt these materials for your own projects!
