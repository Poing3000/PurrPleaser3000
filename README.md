 Automatic cat feeder - Der Katzenfutterautomat

This project aimed to create an automatic feeder for multiple cats. However, please note that development on this multi-feeder has been partially abandoned, as I have shifted focus to a single-feeder project instead. You can find more details about the single-feeder project here: [LINK].

Despite the transition, this repository contains several resources that may still be useful for building a multi-cat feeder, including: Code examples, schematics / a PCB design.

Feel free to explore and adapt these materials for your own projects!
